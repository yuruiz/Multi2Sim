Syntax:

    m2s [<options>] [<x86_binary> [<arg_list>]]

The user command-line supports a sequence of command-line options, and can
include an x86 ELF binary (executable x86 program) followed by its arguments.
The execution of this program will be simulated by Multi2Sim, together with the
rest of the x86 programs specified in the context configuration file (option
'--ctx-config <file>'). The rest of the possible command-line options are
classified in categories and listed next:


================================================================================
General Options
================================================================================

--ctx-config <file>
  Use <file> as the context configuration file. This file describes the
  initial set of running applications, their arguments, and environment
  variables. Type 'm2s --ctx-config-help' for a description of the file
  format.

--ctx-config-help
  Show a help message describing the format of the context configuration
  file, passed to the simulator through option '--ctx-config <file>'.

--elf-debug <file>
  Dump debug information related with the analysis of ELF files. Every time
  an executable file is open (CPU program of GPU kernel binary), detailed
  information about its symbols, sections, strings, etc. is dumped here.

--max-time <time>
  Maximum simulation time in seconds. The simulator will stop once this time
  is exceeded. A value of 0 (default) means no time limit.

--trace <file>.gz
  Generate a trace file with debug information on the configuration of the
  modeled CPUs, GPUs, and memory system, as well as their dynamic
  simulation. The trace is a compressed plain-text file in format. The user
  should watch the size of the generated trace as simulation runs, since
  the trace file can quickly become extremely large.

--visual <file>.gz
  Run the Multi2Sim Visualization Tool. This option consumes a file
  generated with the '--trace' option in a previous simulation. This option
  is only available on systems with support for GTK 3.0 or higher.


================================================================================

  limit. This option is only valid for detailed x86 simulation (option

  limit is given in number of emulated instructions. On x86 detailed
  simulation, it is given as the number of committed (non-speculative)
  instructions. Use 0 (default) for unlimited.

--x86-report <file>
  File to dump a report of the x86 CPU pipeline, including statistics such
  as the number of instructions handled in every pipeline stage, read/write
  accesses performed on pipeline queues, etc. This option is only valid for
  detailed x86 simulation (option '--x86-sim detailed').

--x86-save-checkpoint <file>
  Save a checkpoint of x86 architectural state at the end of simulation.
  Useful options to use together with this are '--x86-max-inst' and
  '--x86-last-inst' to force the simulation to stop and create a checkpoint.
