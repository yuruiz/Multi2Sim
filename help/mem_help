Option '--mem-config <file>' is used to configure the memory system. The
configuration file is a plain-text file in the IniFile format. The memory
system is formed of a set of cache modules, main memory modules, and
interconnects.

Interconnects can be defined in two different configuration files. The first
way is using option '--net-config <file>' (use option '--help-net-config'
for more information). Any network defined in the network configuration file
can be referenced from the memory configuration file. These networks will be
referred hereafter as external networks.

The second option to define a network straight in the memory system
configuration. This alternative is provided for convenience and brevity. By
using sections [Network <name>], networks with a default topology are
created which include a single switch, and one bidirectional link from the
switch to every end node present in the network.

The following sections and variables can be used in the memory system
configuration file:

Section [General] defines global parameters affecting the entire memory
system.

  Frequency = <value>  (Default = 1000)
      Frequency of the memory system in MHz.
  PageSize = <size>  (Default = 4096)
      Memory page size. Virtual addresses are translated into new physical
      addresses in ascending order at the granularity of the page size.
  PeerTransfers = <bool> (Default = transfers)
      Whether or not transfers between peer caches are used.

Section [Module <name>] defines a generic memory module. This section is
used to declare both caches and main memory modules accessible from CPU
cores or GPU compute units.

  Type = {Cache|MainMemory}  (Required)
      Type of the memory module. From the simulation point of view, the
      difference between a cache and a main memory module is that the former
      contains only a subset of the data located at the memory locations it
      serves.
  Geometry = <geo>
      Cache geometry, defined in a separate section of type
      [Geometry <geo>]. This variable is required for cache modules.
  LowNetwork = <net>
      Network connecting the module with other lower-level modules, i.e.,
      modules closer to main memory. This variable is mandatory for caches,
      and should not appear for main memory modules. Value <net> can refer
      to an internal network defined in a [Network <net>] section, or to an
      external network defined in the network configuration file.
  LowNetworkNode = <node>
      If 'LowNetwork' points to an external network, node in the network
      that the module is mapped to. For internal networks, this variable
      should be omitted.
  HighNetwork = <net>
      Network connecting the module with other higher-level modules, i.e.,
      modules closer to CPU cores or GPU compute units. For highest level
      modules accessible by CPU/GPU, this variable should be omitted.
  HighNetworkNode = <node>
      If 'HighNetwork' points to an external network, node that the module
      is mapped to.
  LowModules = <mod1> [<mod2> ...]
      List of lower-level modules. For a cache module, this variable is
      required. If there is only one lower-level module, it serves the
      entire address space for the current module. If there are several
      lower-level modules, each served a disjoint subset of the address
      space. This variable should be omitted for main memory modules.
  BlockSize = <size>
      Block size in bytes. This variable is required for a main memory
      module. It should be omitted for a cache module (in this case, the
      block size is specified in the corresponding cache geometry section).
  Latency = <cycles>
      Memory access latency. This variable is required for a main memory
      module, and should be omitted for a cache module (the access latency
      is specified in the corresponding cache geometry section).
  Ports = <num>
      Number of read/write ports. This variable is only allowed for a main
      memory module. The number of ports for a cache is specified in a
      separate cache geometry section.
  DirectorySize <size>
      Size of the directory in number of blocks. The size of a directory
      limits the number of different blocks that can reside in upper-level
      caches. If a cache requests a new block from main memory, and its
      directory is full, a previous block must be evicted from the
      directory, and all its occurrences in the memory hierarchy need to be
      first invalidated. This variable is only allowed for a main memory
      module.
  DirectoryAssoc = <assoc>
      Directory associativity in number of ways. This variable is only
      allowed for a main memory module.
  AddressRange = { BOUNDS <low> <high> | ADDR DIV <div> MOD <mod> EQ <eq> }
      Physical address range served by the module. If not specified, the
      entire address space is served by the module. There are two possible
      formats for the value of 'Range':
      With the first format, the user can specify the lowest and highest
      byte included in the address range. The value in <low> must be a
      multiple of the module block size, and the value in <high> must be a
      multiple of the block size minus 1.
      With the second format, the address space can be split between
      different modules in an interleaved manner. If dividing an address
      by <div> and modulo <mod> makes it equal to <eq>, it is served by
      this module. The value of <div> must be a multiple of the block size.
      When a module serves only a subset of the address space, the user must
      make sure that the rest of the modules at the same level serve the
      remaining address space.

Section [CacheGeometry <geo>] defines a geometry for a cache. Caches using
this geometry are instantiated [Module <name>] sections.

  Sets = <num_sets> (Required)
      Number of sets in the cache.
  Assoc = <num_ways> (Required)
      Cache associativity. The total number of blocks contained in the cache
      is given by the product Sets * Assoc.
  BlockSize = <size> (Required)
      Size of a cache block in bytes. The total size of the cache is given
      by the product Sets * Assoc * BlockSize.
  Latency = <cycles> (Required)
      Hit latency for a cache in number of cycles.
  Policy = {LRU|FIFO|Random} (Default = LRU)
      Block replacement policy.
  MSHR = <size> (Default = 16)
      Miss status holding register (MSHR) size in number of entries. This
      value determines the maximum number of accesses that can be in flight
      for the cache, including the time since the access request is
      received, until a potential miss is resolved.
  Ports = <num> (Default = 2)
      Number of ports. The number of ports in a cache limits the number of
      concurrent hits. If an access is a miss, it remains in the MSHR while
      it is resolved, but releases the cache port.
  DirectoryLatency = <cycles> (Default = 1)
      Latency for a directory access in number of cycles.
  EnablePrefetcher = {t|f} (Default = False)
      Whether the hardware should automatically perform prefetching.
      The prefetcher related options below will be ignored if this is
      not true.
  PrefetcherType = {GHB_PC_CS|GHB_PC_DC} (Default GHB_PC_CS)
      Specify the type of global history buffer based prefetcher to use.
      GHB_PC_CS - Program Counter indexed, Constant Stride.
      GHB_PC_DC - Program Counter indexed, Delta Correlation.
  PrefetcherGHBSize = <size> (Default = 256)
      The hardware prefetcher does global history buffer based prefetching.
      This option specifies the size of the global history buffer.
  PrefetcherITSize = <size> (Default = 64)
      The hardware prefetcher does global history buffer based prefetching.
      This option specifies the size of the index table used.
  PrefetcherLookupDepth = <num> (Default = 2)
      This option specifies the history (pattern) depth upto which the
      prefetcher looks at the history to decide when to prefetch.

Section [Network <net>] defines an internal default interconnect, formed of
a single switch connecting all modules pointing to the network. For every
module in the network, a bidirectional link is created automatically between
the module and the switch, together with the suitable input/output buffers
in the switch and the module.

  DefaultInputBufferSize = <size>
      Size of input buffers for end nodes (memory modules) and switch.
  DefaultOutputBufferSize = <size>
      Size of output buffers for end nodes and switch.
  DefaultBandwidth = <bandwidth>
      Bandwidth for links and switch crossbar in number of bytes per cycle.

Section [Entry <name>] creates an entry into the memory system. An entry is
a connection between a CPU core/thread or a GPU compute unit with a module
in the memory system.

  Arch = { x86 | Evergreen | SouthernIslands | ... }
      CPU or GPU architecture affected by this entry.
  Core = <core>
      CPU core identifier. This is a value between 0 and the number of cores
      minus 1, as defined in the CPU configuration file. This variable
      should be omitted for GPU entries.
  Thread = <thread>
      CPU thread identifier. Value between 0 and the number of threads per
      core minus 1. Omitted for GPU entries.
  ComputeUnit = <id>
      GPU compute unit identifier. Value between 0 and the number of compute
      units minus 1, as defined in the GPU configuration file. This variable
      should be omitted for CPU entries.
  DataModule = <mod>
  ConstantDataModule = <mod>
  InstModule = <mod>
      In architectures supporting separate data/instruction caches, modules
      used to access memory for each particular purpose.
  Module = <mod>
      Module used to access the memory hierarchy. For architectures
      supporting separate data/instruction caches, this variable can be used
      instead of 'DataModule', 'InstModule', and 'ConstantDataModule' to
      indicate that data and instruction caches are unified.
